</p>

**Accomplishment Statement**  
Sole developer on an internal initiative, where I designed and deployed a modular Python + Docker pipeline with a lightweight React frontend to process and index unstructured investigative data offline. Built reproducible containerized services (Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Nominatim, Apache Joshua, Portainer, etc.), implemented entity and face recognition extraction, and validated the architecture with synthetic persona-based test data. The system accelerated investigative workflows by surfacing relevant evidence metadata in massive, mostly unusable data dumps.  

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Situation
- Internal MIT Lincoln Lab project focused on processing and organizing large investigative datasets.
- Partnered with local law enforcement agency based in New York. 
- Team downsized to just two people: myself (sole developer) and a program manager.  
- Strict constraints: data access restrictions, offline-only operation, reproducible environments.  
- Internal funding required completion of an entrepreneurial validation program.
- Program manager conducted customer discovery interviews with a variety of local law enforcement agencies.
- Personally balancing full-time engineering responsibilities with Boston University online graduate coursework.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task
- Take ownership of the entire repository and deliver a functional end-to-end system.  
- Architect a full pipeline capable of handling multiple document types (text, video, etc.).  
- Ensure modular, reproducible, and offline-ready deployment via containerization.  
- Build a simple frontend for creating ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù (investigations) and running processing jobs.  
- Align development with stakeholder validation interviews conducted by program manager.
- Selecting appropriate software business model.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Actions
- Designed a modular, Dockerized Python pipeline integrating Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Postgres, and Nominatim.  
- Added machine translation (Apache Joshua) and entity extraction with CoreNLP, spaCy, regex, and face recognition.  
- Created reproducible builds with Docker Compose and implemented automated testing via pytest.  
- Collaborated on synthetic datasets to simulate investigations while protecting sensitive data.  
- Shadowed the program manager during stakeholder validation sessions.
- Decided to pursue hybrid open source business model.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Results
- Delivered a functional prototype validated by law enforcement and NGO partners.  
- Proved reproducible offline systems viable for secure environments.  
- Gained experience in full-stack design, NLP, and container orchestration.
