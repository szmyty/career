  <br>
  <em>Figure 1: Order from chaos ‚Äî a visual representation of system design and human clarity.</em>
</p>

**Accomplishment Statement**  
Sole developer on an internal initiative, where I designed and deployed a modular Python + Docker pipeline with a lightweight React frontend to process and index unstructured investigative data offline. Built reproducible containerized services (Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Nominatim, Apache Joshua, Portainer, etc.), implemented entity and face recognition extraction, and validated the architecture with synthetic persona-based test data. The system accelerated investigative workflows by surfacing relevant evidence metadata in massive, mostly unusable data dumps.  

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Situation
- Internal MIT Lincoln Lab project focused on processing and organizing large investigative datasets.  
- Team downsized to just two people: myself (sole developer) and a program manager.  
- Strict constraints: data access restrictions, offline-only operation, reproducible environments.  
- Internal funding required completion of an entrepreneurial validation program.  
- Personally balancing full-time engineering responsibilities with Boston University online graduate coursework.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task
- Take ownership of the entire repository and deliver a functional end-to-end system.  
- Architect a full pipeline capable of handling multiple document types (text, video, etc.).  
- Ensure modular, reproducible, and offline-ready deployment via containerization.  
- Build a simple frontend for creating ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù (investigations) and running processing jobs.  
- Align development with stakeholder validation interviews conducted by program manager.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Actions
- **Backend Architecture**  
  - Designed a Python-based document-processing pipeline, containerized with **Docker & Docker Compose**.  
  - Deployed **Portainer** to simplify IT team operations and container management.  
  - Integrated open-source services: Apache Tika, Elasticsearch + Kibana, Postgres, Nominatim, Apache Joshua.  
- **Entity Extraction**: Implemented multi-pronged extraction (CoreNLP, spaCy, regex, face recognition).  
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Modular doc-type pipelines normalized into Elasticsearch + Postgres.  
- **Frontend Development:** Extended React skills to prototype a minimal UI for investigations.  
- **Testing & Repo Hygiene:** Added pytest, mock entities, Docker best practices.  
- **Synthetic Data Strategy:** Collaborated with manager to create LaTeX + Python persona generator.  
- **Entrepreneurial Learning:** Shadowed manager in interviews with law enforcement and NGOs.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Results
- Delivered a functional full-stack system for analyzing unstructured datasets.  
- Validated strong demand among law enforcement for automated metadata surfacing.  
- Proved feasibility of offline containerized deployment.  
- Built foundational code and patterns for reproducibility and scale.
