## üåü STARS #1: Counter-Human Trafficking Pipeline

**Accomplishment Statement**  
Sole developer on an internal initiative, where I designed and deployed a modular Python + Docker pipeline with a lightweight React frontend to process and index unstructured investigative data offline. Built reproducible containerized services (Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Nominatim, Apache Joshua, Portainer, etc.), implemented entity and face recognition extraction, and validated the architecture with synthetic persona-based test data. The system accelerated investigative workflows by surfacing relevant evidence metadata in massive, mostly unusable data dumps.  

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Situation
- Internal MIT Lincoln Lab project focused on processing and organizing large investigative datasets.  
- Team downsized to just two people: myself (sole developer) and a program manager.  
- Strict constraints: data access restrictions, offline-only operation, reproducible environments.  
- Internal funding required completion of an entrepreneurial validation program.  
- Personally balancing full-time engineering responsibilities with Boston University online graduate coursework.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task
- Take ownership of the entire repository and deliver a functional end-to-end system.  
- Architect a full pipeline capable of handling multiple document types (text, video, etc.).  
- Ensure modular, reproducible, and offline-ready deployment via containerization.  
- Build a simple frontend for creating ‚Äúworkspaces‚Äù (investigations) and running processing jobs.  
- Align development with stakeholder validation interviews conducted by program manager.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Actions
- **Backend Architecture**  
  - Designed a Python-based document-processing pipeline, containerized with **Docker & Docker Compose**.  
  - Deployed **Portainer** to simplify IT team operations and container management.  
  - Integrated open-source services:  
    - **Apache Tika** ‚Üí document parsing.  
    - **Elasticsearch + Kibana** ‚Üí indexing and search visualization.  
    - **Postgres** ‚Üí relational database for storing workspace and investigation data.  
    - **Nominatim** ‚Üí offline geocoding/reverse geocoding for contextual enrichment.  
    - **Apache Joshua** ‚Üí machine translation (proof of concept for Spanish, Mandarin, etc.).

    - **Stanford CoreNLP**  
    - **spaCy** (Python)  
    - **Regex rules** for specialized cases  
    - **Face recognition** for image/video content  
  - Normalized extracted entities into consistent metadata for indexing.  

- **Pipeline Orchestration**  
  - Designed modular doc-type pipelines (text, video, etc.) ‚Üí all normalized into **structured Elasticsearch indices + Postgres objects**.  
  - Built hooks to ensure reliability: data was written to Postgres before being indexed into Elasticsearch.  
  - Each workspace/investigation mapped to its own Elasticsearch index, enabling clean search separation.  

- **Frontend Development**  
  - Extended React skills to prototype a minimal UI.  
  - Allowed users to create investigation workspaces and run sync commands on data folders.  

- **Testing & Repo Hygiene**  
  - Implemented **pytest** for automated testing.  
  - Mocked entities to ensure robustness and validate data flows.  
  - Researched and configured best practices for **Dockerfiles, configs, and CI-like structure** to make the repo reliable and self-sufficient.  

- **Synthetic Data Strategy**  
  - Collaborated with program manager on a **LaTeX + Python persona generator**.  
  - Produced synthetic evidence files simulating real-world investigative scenarios, allowing full-pipeline testing without sensitive data.  

- **Entrepreneurial Learning**  
  - Shadowed program manager in validation interviews with law enforcement and NGOs.  
  - Learned how technical design maps to practical adoption and workflow integration.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Results
- Delivered a **barebones but functional full-stack system** capable of processing, extracting, and indexing diverse unstructured data sources.  
- Validated the **demand and feasibility** of the system: stakeholders confirmed need for automated metadata surfacing to accelerate investigations.  
- Proved ability to deploy **offline, reproducible containerized services** for sensitive environments.  
- Built foundational code and design patterns that demonstrated technical feasibility and secured credibility for the program.  
- Personally developed advanced skills across **full-stack, DevOps, NLP, and systems architecture**.

- **Testing & DevOps**: pytest, repo hygiene, reproducible builds, CI-style config  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Personal Strengths
- **Resilience** ‚Üí balanced full-time work + grad school + solo developer responsibilities.  
- **Adaptability** ‚Üí quickly learned React, Docker, NLP tools under pressure.  
- **Initiative** ‚Üí owned entire repository, from backend to frontend.  
- **Strategic Thinking** ‚Üí adopted entrepreneurial validation and synthetic data testing strategies.  
- **Mission-Driven Focus** ‚Üí built technology to empower investigators with actionable insights.
