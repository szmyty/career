## STARS #1: Counter-Human Trafficking Pipeline

**Accomplishment Statement**  
Sole developer on an internal counter-human trafficking initiative, where I designed a Python + Docker pipeline and lightweight React frontend to process unstructured investigation data offline. Built reproducible containerized services (Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Nominatim, etc.) and validated the architecture with synthetic persona-based test data, aligning technical delivery with real-world law enforcement needs.  

---

**Situation**  
- Internal MIT Lincoln Lab project aimed at addressing human trafficking investigations.  
- Team shrank to just two people: myself (sole developer) and one program manager.  
- Data access was restricted and difficult, requiring offline, reproducible systems.  
- Funding required an entrepreneurial validation program to ensure mission fit.  
- Personally balancing full-time engineering work while completing online graduate school coursework.  

**Task**  
- Take ownership of the entire repository and build a functional end-to-end system.  
- Architect and implement both backend pipelines and a minimal frontend for investigations.  
- Ensure containerized, offline operation across environments.  
- Validate workflow feasibility using synthetic datasets and stakeholder interviews.  

**Actions**  
- **Backend**: Built a document-processing pipeline in Python, containerized with Docker for portability.  
  - Integrated open-source tools: Apache Tika, Elasticsearch, Kibana.  
  - Created offline containerized geocoding service (Nominatim) to enrich context without internet access.  
- **Frontend**: Extended my React skills to prototype a simple interface.  
  - Users could create an “investigation workspace” and run sync commands to process documents.  
- **Testing & Dev Practices**:  
  - Implemented pytest suites, mocking entities to ensure code robustness.  
  - Improved repo hygiene: Dockerfiles, configs, CI-style testing for reliability.  
  - Used research bursts and “cognitive breaks” to continuously refine repo structure and design patterns.  
- **Synthetic Data Strategy**: Collaborated with manager, who built LaTeX/Python scripts to generate persona-driven evidence files, simulating real human trafficking scenarios.  
  - Used this dataset to test pipelines against realistic but privacy-safe workflows.  
- **Entrepreneurial Learning**: Shadowed program manager in validation interviews with law enforcement and NGOs to understand user pain points.  

**Results**  
- Delivered a **barebones but functional pipeline** that processed diverse unstructured documents into indexed, searchable investigations.  
- Validated demand: stakeholders confirmed law enforcement systems lagged technologically, highlighting the pipeline’s potential.  
- Proved feasibility of offline, containerized deployment for sensitive investigation work.  
- Secured internal credibility and met funding deliverables despite resource constraints.  
- Developed full-stack, DevOps, and entrepreneurial skills in one project.  

**Skills / Job Knowledge**  
- Python, pytest, Docker, React, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Apache Tika, Nominatim.  
- Containerization & reproducible builds.  
- Mock testing, repo hygiene, CI-like practices.  
- Data ingestion, indexing, visualization.  

**Personal Strengths**  
- **Resilience**: balanced full-time work + grad school + sole developer role.  
- **Adaptability**: learned React/frontend + advanced Docker under pressure.  
- **Initiative**: took ownership of entire repository and pushed forward independently.  
- **Strategic Thinking**: embraced entrepreneurial validation process and synthetic data testing.  
- **Mission-Driven Focus**: deeply invested in combating trafficking through technology.
